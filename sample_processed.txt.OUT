FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: /Users/arstan/Desktop/sample_processed.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 15
Number of edges: 11
Number of single edges: 11
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 5

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

4 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
3770 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
3774 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 41490 tries were made, 32434 were successful.
Randomization took 0.04 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.03 seconds.
