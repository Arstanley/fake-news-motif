FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: /Users/arstan/Desktop/fake-news-motif/sample_data_processed.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 447
Number of edges: 414
Number of single edges: 414
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 5

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

62813 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
58670848 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
58733661 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 1266933 tries were made, 1243166 were successful.
Randomization took 1.09 seconds.
Enumeration took 132.26 seconds.
